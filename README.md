# Black-Hole-Raytracing
Ray-tracer for Light around Schwarzschild Black Hole

Final Project for Brown General Relativity Course (PHYS1100)

Alex Lawson and Brad Guessman

What would it look like if you stuck a black hole in front of an ordinary image? The extreme mass of the black hole would bend the path of light, warping the image, and some light that ventures to close to black hole, would be sucked in, leaving the image with a black area. 

This project traces the path of light around geodesics defined by the Schwarzschild (non-rotating black hole) Metric. It creates a mapping of pixels from a normal image, to pixels of an image strenched and contorted by the presence of a black hole. Applied to an image, this mapping produces what that image would look like with a large black hole in front of it.

Some Example results are given in the folder 'Image_Results'.
